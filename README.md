# spotify-playlist-downloader

Download your spotify playlist using this simple web app created using React(Frontend) and Express+Python(Backend).

### Features

- Spotify authentication login page
- Display all of your playlist

### Installation

- Clone the git repository
- Run npm start on the root directory to run the server on port 5000
- Cd the client
- Run npm start to start the react project

### TODO

I am planning to add more features to this to make the experience more smooth.

- [ ] Allow choosing playlist that has more than 100 songs (Currently if user select playlist with more than 100 song it only downloads the first 100 songs)
- [ ] Allow user to download any specific song
- [ ] Work on the front end (CSS part) to make it more user loveable.
